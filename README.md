# win10-screen-rec
Intuitive Windows 10 Screen Recorder

(Also check out /win10-rss-monitor, it's another electron project i worked on, that features a proper installer!)

Download the .exe from this link:
(or download the src files from this repo and build the app using node)

run the .exe file and the app will be installed on your computer and opened once installation is finished.

click on "select video source" to select a window to record (or choose to record your entire screen)

a video preview should appear.

click on Start and the app will start recording the selected source (image only, no sound).

to stop recording, just click "stop".

Upon stopping, you will be asked to save the file wherever you want on your computer.

That's it!
